* Big O Notation and others
1. Big O notation: roughly $\leq$ \(f(x) = \mathcal{O}(g(x)\) means \(\exists x \leq x_{0}\), \(0 \leq f(x) \leq C * g(x)\)
2. Big $\Omega$ notation: roughly \(\geq\)
3. Big $\Theta$ notation: roughly \(\approx\)
4. Little variants: remove the equality
5. Poly order: \( f(x) = \text{poly}(g(x))\) means \(f(x) = g(x)^{\mathcal{O}(1)}\)
6. Upto poly-log order: \( f(x) = \tilde{\mathcal{O}}(g(x))\) means \(f(x) =
   g(x) \text{poly}(\log(g(x))\)
